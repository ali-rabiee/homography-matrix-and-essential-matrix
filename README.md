transformation of views using homography matrix and essential matrix

Using homography matrix project image1 to the forward view and image2 on the LCD video wall inside the image3

a) Find the essential matrix that transforms the views 1-2, 2-3, 1-3 (without employing packages).
b) Investigate that transforming 1 to 3 is equivalent to inverse transformation of which two transformations (calculate and print corresponding translation/rotation matrices in your code).
c) Find the essential matrices between each two views using python packages.
d) Repeat (b) for new essential matrices.
e) Find the MSE of the essential matrices obtained by using 8-point algorithm and python packages for each transformations 1-2, 2-3, 1-3.
